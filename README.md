# atom-clang

[LibClang](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html) based code completion and linter for [Atom Editor](http://atom.io)

## Features

* Semantic code completion using [autocomplete-plus](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-plus)
* Diagnostics using [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter)
* Native C++ v8 Node module using [LibClang](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html), no 3rd party dependencies.
  * Fast low-latency completions
  * Easy to setup with your project, no external configuration needed
* Per project configuration supported with [Project Manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager)

## Requirements

Since this is a package uses C++, it will require the package to be compiled. This is automatically done for you by Atom, but it does have some requirements.

* C++11 compiler, either GCC or Clang
* LibClang 3.8 or greater

LibClang is detected via `llvm-config` command. It needs to build and link against the LibClang headers and library. It attempts to find the newest version of `llvm-config` it can on your system. One can override the search by having the `LLVM_CONFIG` environment variable set, e.g. `LLVM_CONFIG=/opt/clang+llvm-3.9.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04/bin/llvm-config`.Currently, I do not know of way "at package install time" through Atom to let the user specify which one to use. See [llvm-config.sh](https://github.com/joeroback/atom-clang/blob/master/llvm-config.sh).

Currently, this only works on Linux and Mac. I do not have a Windows computer. I would welcome any patches / pull requests to add Windows support.

### Installing

This package should be installed through the Atom package manager. Search for package named [atom-clang](https://atom.io/packages/atom-clang). For the bleeding edge, you can clone this repository and link it into Atom with `apm` if desired.

### Global Configuration

This package can work out-of-the-box, but usually requires some minor configuration. This is because parsing with LibClang, literally runs `clang` over your source files and usually needs the `CFLAGS` or `CXXFLAGS` one would use to compile.

You can set global `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`. This will work for any random projects without any major flags.

### Per Project Configuration

Per project configuration with Atom is an ongoing open feature request. Thankfully, [Project Manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager) gives us at least 99% of what we want. It does require you to manually edit the project settings file.

## Keymaps

* TODO: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> Reparse Current Editor
* TODO: <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> Reparse All Editors

## Issues

Please report all issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joeroback/atom-clang/issues).

The more information you can include, the better. CFlags/CXXFlags especially.
Having a reproducible test case would also greatly increase the debug time, though I realize that is not always possible.

## Roadmap

I would love the roadmap to be largely driven by users, but her is a list I came up to get started.

#### Short Term

* Add support for compile_commands.json
* Add support for precompiled headers

#### Long Term

* Replace [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) (I find the interface unsuited for C++ linting, and to be frank, very buggy)
  * Add support for FixIt
* Add support for <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-click code navigation
